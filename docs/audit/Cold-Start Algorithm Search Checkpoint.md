# Cold-start collaboration algorithm search — checkpoint (phases 4-10)

This is a checkpoint, not a locked protocol. It records real literature search and real, cheap,
deterministic POCs run against `outputs/prepared/nbaiot/*.npz` (read-only), reusing the repository's
own `fedorbit.detection.gaussian` / `fedorbit.detection.moments` scoring code so results are directly
comparable to the confirmatory study in `docs/FedORBIT_Results.md`. No confirmatory experiment was
rerun. Full POC scripts and raw CSVs are in `docs/audit/pocs/` (gitignored scratch); this file is the
minimal permanent summary of what survived.

## Bar to beat

`shared-marginals` (per-feature partner mean AND partner standard deviation, local covariance shape),
the confirmatory study's strongest channel, not local-only.

## What was tried and rejected

Two mathematically correct shrinkage estimators — a DerSimonian-Laird-style per-feature
precision-weighted empirical-Bayes blend of local vs. partner-aggregate mean/log-std, and a classical
positive-part James-Stein shrinkage of the local mean in partner-normalised coordinates — both lost to
fixed `shared-marginals` at every tested support size (n=30/100/300/1000), by margins of roughly
0.01-0.09 mean AUROC, unanimous or near-unanimous negative sign. Both are internally correct
applications of real theorems; both fail because their implicit assumption (partners are noisy-but-
unbiased estimates of the same underlying quantity as the target) is false here — the nine physical
devices genuinely differ in absolute traffic scale, so a properly calibrated shrinkage law correctly
infers low trust in the partner reference and barely moves away from the (much worse) local estimate.

## What was found (genuinely new diagnostic result)

A four-way ablation (local mean+local scale / partner mean+partner scale / local mean+partner scale /
partner mean+local scale) shows the collaboration benefit is carried almost entirely by the SCALE
(standard deviation), not the mean: at n=30, "local mean + partner scale" recovers 87% of the full
local-to-marginals AUROC gap, while "partner mean + local scale" recovers under 9%. This holds at every
support size. This decomposition was not previously isolated in the registered study, which only ever
compared "share nothing" against "share both mean and variance" as one bundled channel. Mechanistically
this points to small-sample instability of the per-feature variance estimate (115 correlated features,
n as low as 30) as the actual failure mode, not miscentring.

## Strongest surviving candidate: chi-square-gated variance escalation

**Mechanism.** Keep the local mean always (never replaced by any partner statistic). For each feature j
independently, test H0: local sample variance is consistent with the partner-aggregate variance, using
the standard one-sided lower-tail chi-square test on `(n-1) * local_var_j / partner_var_j ~ chi2_(n-1)`
at alpha=0.05 (a conventional, non-tuned significance level, not fit to this dataset). If the local
variance is significantly *lower* than the partner reference would predict (the specific failure mode
identified above), escalate: replace that feature's scale with the partner's. Otherwise keep the local
variance. This is a per-feature, per-window, evidence-gated decision, not a global switch or a smooth
sample-size-only blend.

**Result (POC, `docs/audit/pocs/chisq_underestimation_gate_poc.py` / `_results.csv`, 15 seeded replicates
x 4 support sizes x 9 devices).** Mean device-level AUROC delta vs. `shared-marginals`: n=30: -0.0046,
n=100: -0.0007, n=300: -0.0004, n=1000: -0.0014 — a near-zero gap at every support size (compare to
-0.07 to -0.09 for the two rejected shrinkage candidates at n=30). Vs. local-standardised it is
unanimous and large: +0.0976 (9/9 devices) at n=30, decaying to +0.0130 (9/9) at n=1000, matching the
registered study's own local-vs-marginals effect size almost exactly (+0.1034 at n=30 in
`docs/FedORBIT_Results.md`). A few individual device/n cells beat `shared-marginals` outright by a small
amount (e.g. Ennio n=1000 +0.0011, Samsung n=30 +0.0001); one cell is clearly worse
(SimpleHome_XCS7_1002 at n=1000, -0.0134). This is honestly reported as a **statistical tie with fixed
shared-marginals**, not a confirmed win — the POC has no significance test and 15 replicates is not the
registered study's 30 — but it is the only candidate of four tested that came close.

**Why this is a genuine (if modest) contribution and not a renamed baseline.** It shares strictly less
information than `shared-marginals` (never uses partner mean at all, and only uses partner variance for
the subset of features flagged as locally unreliable — a materially smaller external-information
footprint), it is per-feature and per-window adaptive rather than a device-level channel switch, and its
escalation criterion is a textbook, pre-specifiable hypothesis test rather than a hand-tuned threshold or
partner-similarity heuristic.

## Not pursued as the final answer

The fraction of features gated to partner variance stays high (69-76%) even at n=1000, because
hypothesis-test power grows with n and the devices have real, persistent per-feature variance
differences from partners; this is a known property of significance-test gating (power increases with
sample size) that should be treated as a first-order risk, not hidden, in any confirmatory design. See
`docs/audit/pocs/checkpoint_poc_results.md` and `novelty_matrix.md` for the full candidate ledger,
closest prior art table, and negative results in detail.
